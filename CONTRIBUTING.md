# Contributing

We are excited to welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're reporting an issue, suggesting a feature, or contributing code, your input is highly valued. Please follow this guide to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure will help you navigate and contribute more effectively:

- **`src/routes`**: Contains the main pages of the app.
- **`src/routes/cipher/[route]`**: The `[route]` represents different cipher pages, as listed in the `README.md`.
- **`src/lib/ciphers`**: Each cipher's logic is implemented as a component in this directory. These components are then imported into the `+page.svelte` file for each corresponding route (e.g., `src/routes/cipher/[route]`).
- **Layouts**: For sub-routes within `cipher`, a `+layout.svelte` file is used to provide the initial layout and structure for the cipher algorithms.

This structure ensures that each cipher operates independently while maintaining a consistent layout across the app.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion, you can report it by opening a new issue in the [Issues](link_to_issues) tab. Please include the following information:

1. **Description**: Clearly explain the issue or suggestion.
2. **Environment**: Share details about your setup (e.g., OS, browser version).
3. **Reproduction Steps**: If it's a bug, list the steps to reproduce the issue.
4. **Screenshots/Code Snippets**: Add any relevant visuals or code to help illustrate the problem.

Your feedback helps us improve the app and is greatly appreciated! üôè

## Contributing Code

To contribute to the codebase, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a Branch**: Make a new branch specific to your feature or bug fix. For example: `feature/new-cipher` or `fix/bug-description`.
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your feature or fix the issue in your forked repository.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to set up the project locally.
5. **Run the Development Server**: Use `npm run dev` to start a local server and test your changes.
6. **Build for Production**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, run `npm run build` to generate the production version.
7. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes, push your branch to your fork, and ensure your commit messages are clear and concise.
8. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the original repository, explaining the changes you made.
9. **Review and Merge**: Wait for maintainers to review your PR. They may suggest changes before merging.
10. **Celebrate**: Once your PR is merged, celebrate your contribution! üéâ

## General Contribution Guidelines

- **Ask Questions**: If you're unsure about anything, feel free to ask in the pull request or open a discussion.
- **Documentation Contributions**: Contributions to documentation are just as valuable as code contributions‚Äîfeel free to improve any part of it.
